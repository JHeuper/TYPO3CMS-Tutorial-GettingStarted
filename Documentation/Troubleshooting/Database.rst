TYPO3 uses UTF-8 encoding, you will need to ensure that your
instance of MySQL also uses UTF-8. When installing TYPO3 for
the first time, you can select UTF-8 encoding when you create
the database for the first time. For an existing database, you
will have to set each table and column to use UTF-8.
